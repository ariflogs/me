⚠️ In Progress...

## Intro

Recently I had to build a website called [Worldly Wanderlust](https://worldlywanderlust.com) for me and my wife, where we can post articles about what's it like living in different parts of the world.\
For the site I had 2 requiremnts.
<br />

👉 Not spend over 2 hours.\
👉 Use open source tools.\
👉 Avoid Wordpress.

and Ghost perfectly met the requiremnt. It's a popular open source blogging platform that I could self host on my VPS.\
In this article, I'll share how I used Ghost with Docker and Caddy to self host my blog

<br />
<br />

### Setup

My VPS config 👇🏼

```
OS: Ubuntu 20.04
CPU: 1 Core,
RAM: 2 GB,
DISK: 50 GB
COST: $12/month
```



Your configurations might be different, but if you want to use Docker, I will recommend to have minimum 1GB ram.



```
export function BlogPostHeader({ title, pubDate }: Props) {
    return (
        <>
        <h1>{title}</h1>
        <span className="text-sm text-zinc-400">{pubDate}</span>
        </>
    );
}
```
