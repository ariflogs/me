            <p>I{"'"}m a Full-stack developer with focus on backend.</p>
            <p>
              Over the past four years, I have worked with variety of tools and
              technologies in the Web and App development space to solve buiness
              and cunsumer related problems.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Besides building software, I&apos;m passionate about startups and
              small businesses. Over the past few years, I&apos;ve launched
              several side projects. Almost all of them failed, but I&apos;m
              hoping they will lead me to that one overnight success that
              everyone talks about! ðŸ¤žðŸ˜¬
